This folder contains the testing suite for UnitGrader's Sample #1, complete with pre-compiled and pre-configured tests.

Note that the AutoGrader includes the tests via classpath; as such, it is wise to ensure that any compiled (*.class) 
versions of an assignment used during the creation of the test suite should be deleted before use in grading, since 
it may automatically hide student submissions.
