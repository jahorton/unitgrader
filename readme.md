# UnitGrader

The UnitGrader is a Java-based program designed to facilitate unit-test-based grading for programming courses.  

At present the system is relatively small-scale and is based upon the use of JUnit, although this can be used to wrap testing code for other programming languages.  It also provides multiple Reflection-API-based services designed to facilitate the development of simple interface-oriented testing and evaluation and allows points to be awarded upon the success of tests on function-by-function basis for each test case and uses light multithreading to streamline the grading process. 

## Project Setup

If using Eclipse, use File > Import, then choose the Gradle > Existing Gradle Project option.  Then, select the folder where you
cloned this repository to import the project for development and Eclipse's wizard should automatically set things up correctly from there.
